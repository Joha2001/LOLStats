# LOLStats
This project was worked upon during the course COP3530 - Data Structures and Algorithms.
The application pulls data from this website https://www.kaggle.com/paololol/league-of-legends-ranked-matches?select=stats1.csv
# Running the application
After downloading LoLStats from the repository, you must also download the two stats (stats1.csv, and stats2.csv) files from the Kaggle website and
place them in the data folder. Then, all that needs to be done is run the executable.
To navigate the program, you can utilize either the search bar or the scroll bar to look at other champions.
